You can allow relaying from one or more tradebots by setting their names separated with a semicolon (;).
To join Darknet and Lightnet, simply set the value to "Darknet;Lightnet".
To turn relaying off, set the value to "None".

Setting the bot names will now automatically register your bot on the tradebot
and attempt to join the private channel.
